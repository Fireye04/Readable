# Readable
This is a tool under development for using an [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) map's object density as a metric for difficulty. The end goal of this program is to organize maps by readability, with a focus on EZ mod, and make practicing the reading skillset as straightforward as possible.

Please see this repository's wiki for details on design philosophy and documentation.
