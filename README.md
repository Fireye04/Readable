# osu-density
osu!density is a tool under development for using an [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) map's object density as a metric for difficulty.

Playing EZ mod is a highly regarded method of practicing the reading skillset, but getting started with practicing often feels overwhelming without a clear way to start or work your way up. Much like how we practice finger control by slowly working our way up the BPM, the end goal of this program is to organize maps by readability, with a focus on EZ mod, and make practicing the reading skillset as straightforward as possible.
