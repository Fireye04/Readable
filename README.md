# Readable
This is a tool under development for using an [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) map's object density as a metric for difficulty. The end goal of this program is to organize maps by readability, with a focus on EZ mod, and make practicing the reading skillset as straightforward as possible.

Please see this repository's wiki for details on design philosophy and documentation.

# Installation

Coming soon, as soon as I have made GUI.

# Why am I making this program? What game even is this anyway?

osu! is a free-to-play rhythm game where you hit circles to the beat of a song, to the best of your ability. As a player, you need to hover your cursor over each circle or slider and click or drag (usually done with two keys on your keyboard, while the other hand controls the cursor) with precise timing, all without losing rhythm, endurance, or composure while being as accurate as possible.

But wait! [How are you supposed to react this quickly, let alone physically keep up?](https://youtu.be/viNeM4LGNQc) In reality, practicing to meet the demanded aim, speed, and reaction time of beatmaps is moderately straightforward (improvement in osu! is akin to weightlifting; you start small and work your way up). The game makes it easy to organize maps by general difficulty (star rating) or by speed (beats per minute). Then players can work their way up, much like how instrument beginners start with easy songs before moving to challenging ones.

The ability to process the position and timing of each circle falls under the skillset of “reading.” But as players have pushed the fundamental skillsets to insane levels, the ability to consistently process many objects at once sets good players apart from the top. This is best illustrated by the in-game mod, "EZ," which nerfs the required reaction time in exchange for larger circle size and forcing the player to read high object “density.”

Hence, EZ is regarded as a highly effective way of training reading, but it is really overwhelming to get started and progress further into this skillset. That’s why I’m building Readable to make practicing reading as straightforward as possible.
